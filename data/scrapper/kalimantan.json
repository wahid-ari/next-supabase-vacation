    "description": "Explore Banjarmasin, Kalimantan's urban hub intertwined with rivers. Discover floating markets, canals, and rich cultural heritage in this vibrant city",
    "content": "<h1>Banjarmasin</h1><p>The City of Thousand Rivers</p><p class=\"fs-6 border-top fw-light\">\n<p><span>Banjarmasin is the best place to absorb Kalimantan\u2019s urban culture, both on land as on the waters. Located on a delta near the junction of the Barito and Martapura rivers, Banjarmasin, together with its neighboring city, Banjarbaru, form the center of the ninth largest metropolitan city in Indonesia.</span></p>\n<p><span>From ancient times and up to this day, Banjarmasin has remained an important harbor town on Kalimantan. It has an abundance of wide and mighty rivers, which have always played a significant role in the Banjarese\u2019 (the indigenous ethnic group of Banjarmasin) way of life. To this very day, every morning there are floating markets where farmers and merchants ply their goods on boats to trade.\u00a0</span><span>The town\u2019s main attractions are the suburbs that are traversed by canals, where much of the city's commerce takes place on the water.</span></p>\n<p><span>The most notable of these river markets is the Muara Kuin Floating Market located on the Barito River. The floating market is the place to see the traffic of all kinds of boats laden with bananas, shrimps, fish, yams, spinach, coconut, incandescent spices and chilies, buckets of fuzzy rambutans, and whatever other fruit are in season. Maneuvering their boats with dexterity and precision, since the boats are constantly wobbled by the river\u2019s waves, traders exchange goods and money.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Get There</span></p>\n<p><span><b>By Air</b></span></p>\n<p><span>There are daily flights from many Indonesian cities including from <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jakarta</u></a>, Surabaya, Bandung, Balikpapan,\u00a0Sampit\u00a0and\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/kalimantan/pangkalan-bun.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Pangkalan Bun</u></a></span><span>\u00a0to Banjarmasin\u2019s airport of\u00a0Syamsuddin Noor (BDJ)\u00a0. The airport is 26 km from Banjarmasin, or about half an hour \u2018s drive from the city. To go to the city, you can take a taxi (with fixed rate) or better yet, tell your hotel to pick you up.</span></p>\n<p><b><span>By Ship</span></b></p>\n<p><span>Another alternative to get to Banjarmasin is by ship from various places in Indonesia to Banjarmasin\u2019s main harbor, named\u00a0Trisakti. The sea trip will take approximately 2 days and 2 nights from\u00a0Jakarta\u2019s Tanjung Priok Harbor\u2019s Passenger Terminal. Plus, there are ferries from\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/semarang.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Semarang</u></a></span><span>\u00a0and\u00a0</span><span>Surabaya</span><span>, both on Java. There's a ferry every 2 days between Surabaya and Banjarmasin.</span></p>\n<p><span>The ferry between Surabaya and Banjarmasin takes 21 hours. If you have a problem with cigarette smoke, this is not a good method to travel since smoking is permitted in the sleeping area. There are no cabins. Females travelling solo should be aware that they will receive a considerable amount of male attention, most of it unwanted. The food is also not good.</span></p>\n<p><b><span>By Bus</span></b></p>\n<p><span>There are public buses from\u00a0Balikpapan\u00a0to Banjarmasin, which will take a little over 14 hours.</span></p>\n<p><b>By\u00a0 River</b></p>\n<p><span>Alternatively, if you are coming from the neighbouring provinces of East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, there is plenty of boat transportation on the rivers of Kalimantan. This could be an adventurous or boring ride depending on your taste. A range of boats are available, from slow moving traditional boats to speedboats. It\u2019s a great choice if you are extremely adaptable to the local's way of life.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Unlike other towns in Indonesia, Singkawang has a distinct oriental atmosphere with hundreds of Chinese temples found around almost every corner of town.

One of the oldest temples here is the Tri Dharma Bumi Raya temple that established in 1878 dedicated to the God of the forest, or Tua Peh Kong. Normally a quiet city, Singkawang comes alive each Chinese New Year, reaching its climax at Capgome, or the fifteenth day of Chinese New Year, closing the celebrations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Singkawang is also famous for its Chinese ceramics, still produced in the old style with \u201cantique\u201d designs. Besides visiting the many temples, especially the main temple at Tri Dharma Bumi Raya, Singkawang is famous for its food centres which come alive at night.
