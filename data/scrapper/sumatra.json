Traveling between the 2 main areas, (Tanjungkarang to Teluk Betung) will only take about 30-40 minutes by car. If you wish to mingle with the locals, you can try to take a ride in the angkutan kota or angkot, that came with different designated routes for different areas and distinguished by different colors. When you are near your destination, don\u2019t forget to ask the driver to stop at the left side, so you can get off.

The sand is soft and as white as palm sugar, and some even argue that the sand here is even whiter than that in Bali. Belitung is also surrounded by more than 100 small islands. Almost all of them are decorated with white sand and granite rocks, and only a few are inhabited. One island in particular, the Lengkuas Island is the site of a 19th century antique light house. The Light House was built in Dutch colonial times and offers a beautiful overview of the area. Burung (Birds) Island, Babi (Pig) Island, Pengadaran Island, Lutung Island, Kera (Apes) Island and Jenang Island, are among some of the smaller islands that offer great experiences.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get Around</p>\n<p>Belitung is small enough that some interesting points on the island can be reached in less than two hours from Tanjung Pandan. However, taxis are non-existant and public transportation on the island is hard to find, so the only practical way to move around is to rent a car or a motorcycle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get There</p>\n<p>From <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jakarta</a></u>, the easiest way to get to Belitung is obviously by airplane. There are several daily Boeing 737 aircraft served by Sriwijaya Air leaving from Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno Hatta airport direct to Hanandjoeddin Airport in Tanjung Pandan, Belitung. All flights from Jakarta to Belitung depart from Soekarno-Hatta Airport. The flight takes 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can take the Sea route by PELNI passenger ship from the Tanjung Priok harbor, in Jakarta. Keep in mind that the ship only serves travel to Belitung once every 2 weeks. The journey will take about 24 hours.</p>\n<p>From the Provincial capital, <u><a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/sumatra/pangkalpinang.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pangkalpinang</a></u>, you can get to Belitung Island by taking the daily Bahari speed boats that will take 4 hours. This is by far the most convenient means of Sea transportation and comes complete with air conditioner. Bahari express leaves daily at 14:00 pm from Pangkalpinang, Bangka, to Belitung, and leaves at 07:00 am from Tanjungpandan Belitung to Pangkalpinang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

Keep in mind that the last direct bus back to Rajabasa Lama returns at 03:00 pm Western Indonesia Time, and it is best if you arrive before dusk, since the ojek driver won\u2019t drive you there after this time. The whole trip would take approximately around 2-3 hours. Alternatively, from Bandar Lampung, you can catch a bus to Metro and subsequently another bus to Rajabasa Lama which also last around 2-3 hours.</p>\n<p>If you happen to use or rent a car, from Bandar Lampung take the Kota Bumi Road northward and just follow the serial elephant signs that will easily take you to WKNP. It is possible to hire a taxi from Bandar Lampung to Way Kambas but it is considerably more expensive. From Bandarlampung to east Lampung district, the roads are relatively in good condition. However, as you enter Sukadana area the trip will get a little bumpy since some parts of the road are in poor condition. From Way Jepara market to the entrance of WKNP the poorly condition road last for about 5 km.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"

If you\u2019re on Samosir Island, take the day to explore by taking a drive on the road running around the edge of the island. Although rough and unpaved in places, this road offers some spectacular views of the lake from the highest points on the island. If you\u2019re staying in the popular village of Tuk Tuk on Samosir, the best way to get around is to walk or wander, down the main street at a leisurely pace.</p>\n<h2><b>Attraction</b></h2>\n<p>There are many ways for you to enjoy Lake Toba\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/8-must-visit-places-in-lake-toba.html\" target=\"Target\">breathtaking natural wonders</a>. Many people said that kayaking in Lake Toba is a once-in-a-lifetime-experience. Commonly, there are three routes that you can explore by paddling the kayak, which is Tongging - Silalahi (12 km - Easy), Tongging - Samosir (50 km - Medium), and Northern Circle (175 km - Demanding). You can also savor the cool breeze from around the lake by glamping (glamorous camping) on The Kaldera Nomadic Escape. Located on Sibisa, Ajibata Sub-district, Toba Samosir Regency, you can immerse yourself in nature without having to bother with the common hassles of conventional camping. Moreover, you can also be pampered with its luxurious facilities such as Bohemian-style tents, bubble tents, eco pods, and also an amphitheater with a capacity of 300 people.</p>\n<p>Located on the island of Samosir, the traditional village is protected by surrounding barriers of earthen ramparts with bamboo fencing and trees. The village also dwells in many unique and authentic traditional houses, especially from Tomok, which consists of a row of massive wooden houses with striking saddle-shaped thatch roofs made of sugar palm fiber (called ijuk).</p>\n<p>Batak tribe is widely known for its festive culture. Among others, Tor-Tor Dance is considered to be the most elegant one. This traditional dance is usually performed in celebrations such as harvest time or a wedding ceremony. However, according to history, Tor-Tor Dance is used in a ritual to invoke spirit and \u2018walk\u2019 them into the stone statues, which erected as a symbol of the ancestors.</p>\n<p>Also, there is a wooden puppet called Sigale-gale, which has become a tourist attraction in Samosir Island because of the mystical value within the myth and belief surrounding the puppet itself. The locals believed that Sigale-gale can wail and dance by itself without music. Some also said that Sigale-gale can only be placed in a coffin. This statue is also commonly used in family death ceremonies in the Samosir area because Sigale-gale dance is believed by local residents to deliver the spirit of the deceased to the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Those of you who are looking for souvenirs might want to take a look at Ulos, a meticulously handwoven textile which not only functions as clothing, but also is a significant status symbol, serves as a precious heirloom, or can be a ceremonial gift during a human\u2019s life cycle from birth and wedding to death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also authentic wood carvings that you can get in the souvenir shops. Don\u2019t forget to also buy the delightful Arabica coffee beans called Sumatra Mandheling for all of you coffee-aficionado.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</p>"
