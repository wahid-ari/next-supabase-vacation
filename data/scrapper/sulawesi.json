The water of the lake pours in a river and out into the <a href=\"https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/sulawesi/gorontalo/tomini-bay-and-olele-beach.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Tomini Bay</u></a> by the town of Poso. The lake spans across an area of 32,000 hectares, and, with a depth of 515 meters at its deepest points, it is almost three times deeper than the Java Sea which has a mean depth of 151 meters only. Silver and yellow eels criss-cross the lake together with two endemic species of fish. The center of the lake is crystal blue, outlined by a shade of green and bordered with soft white and golden sands. Rolling hills surround this enchanting lake, covered with stretches of bright, green rice fields, fragrant clove trees and tropical forests.
