The historical El Tari airstrip that was first landed by an American pilot, Lamij Johnson, in 1928 holds many stories, more than being a mere transit lounge and fuel depot for the few fliers back then. Today, when visitors step on to the modernizing city, one can still find traces of Dutch occupation as well as a Portuguese inherited aura. For since long before Indonesia’s Independence, Timor’s western part had been colonized by the Dutch while the islands eastern part by the Portuguese. This division originated from the time when these two powers fought for hegemony in the lucrative spice trade.</p><p>Today, Kupang is the capital city of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, perched in the southwestern part of Timor Island. As one of the three largest islands in East Nusa Tenggara (comprising Sumba, Flores and Timor), Timor island is now shared by two independent countries. The island’s eastern part being the newly independent East Timor – or Timor Leste, while the island’s western part is Indonesian territory. Its favorable position in the south-eastern most part of Indonesia, has made the city of Kupang into the first port of entry in Indonesian waters from Australia, if not yet as a tourist destination in its own right.</p><p>The Nusa Tenggara is a string of islands to the east of Bali, while Timor is its easternmost island in that string. Topographically, Timor differs from the rest of the East Nusa Tenggara islands. For the line of volcanoes that runs from Sumatra, Java, and on to other Nusa Tenggara islands, skips Timor and continues north to Maluku or the Moluccas. The cause of this is that unlike other Nusa Tenggara islands, Timor is in fact geologically related to Australia, and therefore has no volcanoes. While it geographical location and long history and tradition make it culturally Indonesian.</p><p>Being closest than any Indonesian cities to the marinas of Australian yachts in Darwin, the lighthouse at the seaport of Kupang stands as the first milepost for participating yachtsmen in the annual Sail Indonesia event. Each year, hundreds of yachts cross the open seas from Darwin, Australia sailing to Kupang, and from here to visit many known as well as remote Indonesian islands, to finally dock in Singapore. The annual Sail Indonesia has brought the name of Koepang to the fore, recalling its fame in the early twentieth century.</p><p>“Indonesians laugh a lot”, said Prooke of Marlborough, UK. It’s the land of laughs and smiles.</p><p>People in Timor are friendly. They love to laugh as do most Indonesians on the whole. Traditionally, people in Kupang and West Timor were distinguished by their social positions. The nobility here used to be called Amaf, the rulers Atupas, the commons Too, and slaves Ata. Today, ata no longer exist. Each of the social class had its own role to play in society. Yet, these classes share a mutual sentiment when it comes to tradition. The root of its heritage is so deep, making it difficult to trace. These deep rooted traditions even persisted through centuries of teachings of newer religions that were brought by traders or colonial rulers.</p><p>Look at the motives and patterns of their woven cloths called tenun ikat, and one can sense its age old heritage. Tenun ikat is the local craftsmanship in producing beautifully and sometimes mysteriously formed patterns on traditionally woven fabrics. Not only are the people proud of these cloths, but all Indonesians share the pride that these cloths are one of Indonesia’s most precious tangible national heritage.</p><p><strong>Get There</strong></p><p>Kupang is accessible by plane or ferries. Its historical airport, El Tari was formerly known as Penfui airstrip, having first served an American pilot, Lamij Johnson, in 1928. Penfui literally means ‘bush of cornfields’, since the airstrip’s surroundings were heavily covered with cornfields. El Tari connects western Timor Island with other large cities in Indonesia.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/kupangH.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/kupang-on-timur

This national park is approximately 100Km from Bali’s capital city, <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/denpasar.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><u>Denpasar,</u></a> or about 50 km west from the northern city of Singaraja, capital of Buleleng regency.</p><p>West Bali National Park has a total area of 19,002.89 hectares, covering 15,587.89 hectares of land and 3,415 hectares of water. The habitat is very varied with rainforests, dry savannas, acacia scrubs and lowland forests, as well as more montane forests in the higher region. There are also some pockets of dense mangrove forests. In the north of the park is an obvious north jutting peninsula called Prapat Agung. Around this peninsula are long stretches of protected beach and offshore coral reefs as well as a small offshore island called <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/menjangan-island.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><u>Menjangan</u></a> . The latter is a very popular diving destination.</p><p>One hundred and sixty species of birds have been recorded in the park, including the near extinct Bali Starling (<em>Leucopsar rothschildi</em>), Bali's only endemic vertebrate species,the fauna icon of Bali. It was the key reason why this national park was created in 1941. By 2001, it was estimated that as few as only six individual starlings were thought to have survived in the wild, all of them in this park. Since then, captive breeding and re-introduction efforts have continued apace, but poaching pressures remain a large problem. With that in mind, a second re-introduction program was started in the remote regions of Nusa Penida, off the coast of Sanur Beach in 2004. In June 2011, West Bali National Park received 60 endangered Bali Starling for release, 40 from the <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/surabaya.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><u>Surabaya</u></a> Zoo and 20 from <a href=""http://202.72.206.26:4502/content/indtravelrevamp/id/en/destinations/java/bogor/taman-safari.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><u>Taman Safari</u> Indonesia</a> .

The good drop-offs on Menjangan's south side are only surpassed by the particularly superb reefs on its northern shores. The island is a popular spot for locals and tourists wishing to dive for a variety of fish and coral reef exploration. There are no dangerous currents to contend with in this area.</p><p>West Bali Barat National Park also shows high bio-diversity in a relatively small marine area. At the end of the last century, 110 species of corals belonging to 18 families were recorded, of which 22 species were of the mushroom coral family (there are only 29 species of mushroom corals recorded worldwide), and there were at least 27 species of <em>Acropora</em> coral found in a relatively small area of only 2 hectares.</p><p>With all the splendors that stretch from the heart of its thick jungle to the deep waters that surround the peninsula, West Bali National Park is truly a natural treasure of the fabled island of Bali.</p><p>For permit and information please contact:</p><p>West Bali National Park Head Office:</p><p>Balai Taman Nasional Bali Barat</p><p>Jl.

It’s also one of the largest metropolitan cities in Indonesia, and provides so many compelling itineraries for you to visit.</p><p>Semarang is traversed by many rivers in the middle of the city just like Venice in Italy, thus Netherland ever called this city as <em>Venetië van Java </em>or The Venice of Java. This city is also known as<em> Kota Lumpia </em>or Lumpia City. Lumpia is one of the most delicious snacks you could ever find in Indonesia. It’s a snack born by acculturation of two cultures, Javanese and Chinese, and a typical food from Semarang.</p><p>As one of the huge cities in Indonesia, Semarang is never deserted by tourists all over the world. Let’s learn more about the reasons why.</p><h3>History of Semarang</h3><p>In the 15th century, Chinese emperor’s emissary Zheng He, otherwise known as Admiral Cheng Ho, set foot on Java. From the 17th century onwards, Semarang became an entrepot for spices, also a busy harbor for trade and passengers when travel was made predominantly by sea. The city of Semarang, capital of the province of Central Java, sits precisely in the center of the northern seaboard of the fertile and densely populated island of Java.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/kotalamarevamp.jpg"" alt=""semarang"" width=""500""></p><p>This strategic position of Semarang has made the city a melting pot of Chinese, Indian Arab, and European cultures. Wander around the Chinese quarters and the Dutch commercial district, you will see the influences of different cultures everywhere. In the older part of the city near the harbor named Kota Lama, or the Oudstadt, stroll around to explore the historic old buildings in what was once the European commercial district.</p><h3>What to Do</h3><p>With so many countries sailing to Semarang during those old times, no wonder we can feel the charming old-time <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/semarang-old-town-charming-old-time-heritage-atmosphere"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">heritage atmosphere</a> around the city. These buildings are also influenced by the European style of architecture and also old Chinese architecture style.</p><p>Here is a list you must stop by when you visit Semarang;</p><h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iconic Blenduk Church</h3><p>The most renowned landmark to see here is the Koepelkerk, a Pantheon style church, locally known as Gereja Blenduk, a copper-domed Dutch church dating from 1753.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/benculukrevamp.jpg"" alt=""semarang"" width=""500""></p><h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Canyon</h3><p>Another tourist gem you should consider when you visit Semarang is <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/15-summer-signature-experience-in-the-cities-of-yogya-solo-semarang"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Brown Canyon</a>, located in Rowosari. This landmark showcases its majestic sandy brown cliffs with greenery spread throughout the area. The Brown Canyon's panoramic scenery has brought attention among professional and amateur photographers as it offers similar nuance as the Grand Canyon in America.</p><p>Though originally created for mining, this site has naturally eroded throughout the years, creating a unique structure. Those who are interested to visit this site should consider exploring during the weekends, as it will be filled with workers during workdays.</p><h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical Lawang Sewu</h3><p>Lawang sewu is another historical building in Semarang. Lawang sewu is originally from Javanese language which means building with thousand doors. During the colonial era, this building was used as the headquarters of the Dutch East Indies railway company. Many people believe that this building is haunted and often visited by ghost hunters.</p><h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Poo Kong Temple Complex</h3><p>Sam poo kong is a historical destination built to reminisce Admiral Cheng Ho, a Muslim explorer originating from china. The temple was built in the 15th century and marked as the oldest Chinese temple in Simongan, Semarang.</p><p>The best time to visit this temple is on the sixth month in the lunar calendar. During that time a festival will be held to commemorate the arrival of admiral Cheng Ho in Semarang. One of the most awaited events is when the people parading the statue of Cheng Ho from Tay Kak Sie temple to Sam Poo Kong. Also, during the auspicious days in the lunar calendar or historical omens in Cheng Ho’s history, there will be festivals and celebrations held in front of the yard of the temple.</p><h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Semawis Night Market</h3><p>If you visit Semarang during the weekend, then a visit to Semawis night market is a must. This area of night market is also known as the Chinatown of Semarang. Located in Gang Warung, Semarang, this night market sells a variety of mouth watering Indonesian and Chinese influenced foods and drinks.</p><p>The area which is also known by the locals as Waroeng Semawis was established in 2004 to memorialise the 600 years of Cheng Ho’s first expedition in Semarang. You can simply say this night market is a food street heaven since it is lined with street hawkers of satays, fried rice, soup, noodles, desserts and you could possibly find Semarang specialities such as Pisang Plenet and Lumpia.</p><h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Semarang Iconic’s snacks</h3><p>It will not be complete when you visit any place without trying their local foods and drinks. Semarang is one of the cities where you can fill your cravings for the good foods which will make you want to dig in more and more.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/semarang/semarang-the-venice-of-java/risol.jpg"" alt=""semarang"" width=""500""></p><p>For a complete culinary experience, the Pasar Semawis Culinary Center in Gang Warung is truly a must. Most of the food here is different to what you'll find elsewhere. Here a number of stalls sell mouthwatering dishes with pork in them – a rarity anywhere on Java.</p><h3><strong>Get Around</strong></h3><p>In Semarang, taxi is everywhere. Small buses are visible going by the city streets. They go to different parts of the city. You might want to ask the locals before taking one of those city buses.&nbsp;</p><p>Becak&nbsp;or rickshaw (trishaw) is a pleasant choice to feel the breeze in Semarang while you enjoy the city scenes. When visiting Kota Lama, take one of those&nbsp;becaks, and enjoy the relaxing ride.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Get There</strong></h3><p>Semarang is accessible by air and land.

However, over time Purwakarta has grown into an attractive destination in its own right that showcases its authentic identity as the cultural window to the Sunda ethnic group’s way of life of the people of West Java.</p><p>According to Old Sunda Language of West Java, the name Purwakarta is derived from the word <em>Purwa</em> meaning ‘the beginning/the origin’ and ‘<em>Karta</em>’ meaning ‘lively/active’, hence Purwakarta loosely means ‘a lively place since ancient times’. Purwakarta's existence is inseparable from the nation’s history in the fight against the colonial forces of the<em>Vereenigde Oostindische</em> <em>Compagnie</em> (VOC) or the Dutch East India Company who occupied the region around the 17th century. The regency then played the role as the main logistics base for the Javanese Mataram Kingdom during their attack on the VOC’s controlled Batavia (present day Old Jakarta). In turn, Purwakarta’s rich agricultural resources were later also utilized by the victorious Dutch Colonial Forces.</p><p>Remnants of the Dutch colonial era still decorate many parts of Purwakarta. These can be seen especially found in downtown Purwakarta where heritage sites are transformed into some of the town’s most impressive landmarks.</p><p>The most iconic of these is the <strong>Sri Baduga Fountain Park</strong> at Situ Buleud or the ‘Round Lake’ situated right in the heart of town, which is in fact an artificial lake that was originally built during Dutch Colonial times and meant as a pool for a herd of the now near-extinct rhinoceros population.</p><p>This small lake has now been transformed into the largest Fountain Park in Southeast, called the Sri Baduga Fountain Park, which boasts a 3 hectares sprawling park with at its center musical and dancing fountains using state-of-the-art technology. Here, in its center among the hundreds of dancing fountains sits majestically the statue of Prabu Kian Santang, son of Prabu Siliwangi, also known as Sri Baduga, the most famous Maharaja who ruled ancient Pajajaran. Surrounding the statue, no less than 2,000 water spouts shoot up showers that dance following synchronized music. And enhanced by streams of light in rainbow colors and laser play, they form images of a man and a woman dancing special Sundanese traditional dances.</p><p>Located not too far from the Sri Baduga Fountain Park, there is another historical building believed to have been builtin the 19th century called <strong><em>Gedung Kembar</em></strong> or literally meaning ‘The Twin Building’. Today, one of the buildings is used as a unique Museum named <strong>Bale Panyawangan Diorama Museum</strong>. Loosely translated, Bale Panyawangan means ‘A Place to Gaze’. As the name suggests, here is the perfect place to observe not only into the history of Purwakarta but also of the great Sunda kingdom of Pajajaran, and its culture. Uniquely, the museum does not only feature conventional collections but it is also completed with various digital displays. In one of these, visitors can take a virtual tour of Purwakarta on an actual antique bicycle.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/west-java/purwakarta/69d650966c3bd0acb644d1555d565bd25967fcfa-3236e.jpg"" alt=""An Enchanting Window on Sunda Culture""></p><p> Image by <a href=""http://aryanugrahasoepardi.blogspot.co.id/2016/03/kawasan-wisata-grama-tirta-jatiluhur_9.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Arya Nugraha</a></p><p>For those who wish to enjoy watersports such as canoeing, water skiing, wind surfing, and many others, Purwakarta has the <strong>Grama Tirta Jatiluhur </strong>or the Jatiluhur Waterpark which is built along the Jatiluhur Dam.

Here is the beautiful <strong>Wanayasa Lake </strong>among lush hills surrounding Mount Burangrang. There is also the <strong>Cipurut Waterfall </strong>and the <strong>Cidomas River</strong> which make perfect getaways from the hustle and bustle of daily city life.</p><p>If you’re up for a little bit of adventure, go trek and hike to some of the challenging trails up <strong>Mount Lembu, Mount Parang, Mount Cupu, and Mount Bangkok.</strong></p><p>While you are in Purwakarta, don’t forget to taste the Purwakarta specialty of <strong>Sate Maranggi</strong>, a signature dish of the regency that has become a favorite food of many Indonesians. Made of Lamb or beef, what makes Sate Maranggi different from other sate/satay or meat skewers is that before they are barbequed, the meat for sate maranggi is marinated in various herbs and spices that give it its distinct taste. Sate Maranggi is normally served with fresh cut tomato slices, shallots and a (very hot) spicy sauce.</p><p>Check out more Information on Purwakarta at: <a href=""http://purwakarta-tourism.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">http://purwakarta-tourism.com/</a></p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/west-java/purwakarta/5484e63b9615e860de70436ffdd9c5231011e01e-dd701.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/purwakarta

Further down in history, Magelang once was made into a military post by the Dutch East Indies colonial government. Among remnants of this era is the 1918 Water Tower that still stands to this very day. The regency later acted as an army stronghold for Indonesia's pro-independence movement against the Dutch during the resistance period. Currently, it is host to two military landmarks: The Indonesian National Military Academy, and the military-associated school, Taruna Nusantara.</p><h2><strong>What to See and Do in Magelang</strong></h2><p>The Magnificent&nbsp;<strong>Borobudur Temple</strong>, a UNESCO inscribed World Heritage site, and pride of Indonesia, is definitely the ultimate attraction in Magelang. Sitting majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills, the Borobudur temple is acknowledged as the world's largest Buddhist monument, an ancient site widely considered as one of the world's seven wonders.

Visitors who have an eager interest in volcanic activities must come to the park and witness the smoke of ashes coming from Mount Semeru, an active volcano that rises 3,676 meters above sea level.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/bromo1.jpg"" alt=""bromo"" width=""500""></p><p>Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park is the only conservation area in Indonesia that has a 10 km sea of sand called Tengger, from which four new volcanic cones have emerged. Those volcanic cones are Mount Batok (2,470 m), Mount Kursi (2,581 m), Mount Watangan (2,661 m), and Mount Widodaren (2,650 m). However, Mount Bromo is still the only one that is active. Temperatures at the top of Mount Bromo range about 5-18 degrees Celsius. Heading south of the park is a rolling upland plateau divided by valleys and decorated with several scenic lakes reaching to the foot of Mount Semeru.</p><h2>Get There</h2><p><strong>By Air</strong></p><p>You can fly with Sriwijaya Air, which flies twice daily to Malang from Jakarta. There are also many flights from airlines such as Citilink and Batik Air that fly daily from Jakarta to Surabaya.</p><p><strong>By Land</strong></p><p>There are multiple ways to get into the park. Visitors can come from Probolinggo through the village of Ngadisari. They can also take the north east approach via Pasuruan through the village of Tosari. The third, which is a more difficult approach, is via Ngadas.</p><p>The Probolinggo approach is the easiest and by far the most popular route, especially if the visitors are traveling by public bus. Wonokitri is the closest and the easiest approach if you are coming by private vehicle from Surabaya (5 hours journey). Once you arrive at those villages, you have to rent 4x4 vehicles in order to get closer to Mount Bromo.</p><p>Most tour groups from Surabaya stay overnight at Tretes, where there are a number of hotels, as there are in Malang, which has the added advantage of having an airport. Alternatively, you can also contact a travel agency to arrange your trip.</p><h2>Get Around</h2><p>Many visitors choose to walk while they arrive at the park. There are clearly marked tracks across the sand sea that leads to the foot of Mount Bromo. Alternatively, you can rent a jeep or hire a horse from Cemoro Lawang to get around.</p><h2>Attraction</h2><p><strong>Outdoor Activities</strong></p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/bromo22.jpg"" alt=""bromo"" width=""500""></p><p><em>Image by furstset</em></p><p>Tengger sand sea with its 5.250 hectares area will make a perfect place to walk around or ride a horse and feel like a wild west cowboy. You can also hike to the top of Mount Bromo or, if you feel challenged enough, to the summit of Mount Semeru, which is the highest mountain in the land of Java. For other options, you can watch the beautiful sunrise from Ranu Kumbolo, where the sun will slowly emerge from the valley between the two hills something just like a fairytale.

You can also find other holy water temples in Bali such as&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/ulun-danu-beratan"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">Pura Ulun Danu</a>&nbsp;at Lake Beratan, Pura Tirta Tawar at Gianyar, Pura Tirta Harum at Bangli, Pura Tirta Taman Mumbul at Badung, and many more.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/image1.jpg"" alt=""bali"" width=""500""></p><p>Tirta Empul was founded in 926 A.D and is still being actively used to this day. Although it is a sacred place of worship to the locals, tourists from all over the world are welcome to experience the beauty and participate in the purification rituals. In 2017, the former US President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and daughters Malia and Natasha, made Tirta Empul one of their selected sites to visit and experience.</p><p>If you’re planning to visit Tirta Empul, here’s what to know more about this sacred temple:</p><h3><strong>The inside of Tirta Empul&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple is located in the village of Manukaya, near the town of Tampaksiring, not far from Ubud, in the Gianyar Regency, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">cultural heart of Bali</a>. The temple is situated just below the Presidential Palace of Tampaksiring. Built-in 1957 by Indonesia's first president, Soekarno, the beautifully built palace itself is an important landmark of the island and the country. Together with the Presidential Palace, the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple provides some of the most fascinating views you will ever see.</p><p>As a petirtaan or bathing center, Tirta Empul is quite a large temple complex and it takes at least 30 minutes to an hour to explore the entire site. Just as at other temples and sacred sites around the island, you will need to put on a 'sarong' before entering the premises. The sarongs are available at the temple's entrance and can be rented for a small donation.</p><p>As soon as you enter the temple, you will walk through the large stone Balinese gate (locally known as candi bentar) and arrive in the outer courtyard of the temple. This area of the temple is called jaba sisi. At the end of the courtyard is another candi bentar built into the wall that leads to the central courtyard. This gate is guarded by smoothly carved huge statues of two Dwarapala or guardians given a brush of golden colors. At the top of the gate is a carving of Kala which is quite different from other Kala carvings elsewhere since it has fangs that stick upwards and a pair of hands with open arms.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/image2.jpg"" alt=""bali"" width=""500""></p><p>Entering the inner courtyard, you will arrive at the jaba tengah area which is the main area of the temple. The holy springs here bubble up into a large, crystal-clear pool within the temple and gush out through 30 waterspouts into the two sacred purification pools. Local Balinese and Hindu worshippers stand in long lines in the pools waiting to dip their heads under the waterspouts in a purification ritual known as melukat. Bathers start in the pool on the left side standing in the pool to the waist under the first water spout. Once they have cleansed themselves under the first spout they join the next queue. This process is continued until they have cleansed themselves under each waterspout. However, there are two spouts that are meant only for cleansing the dead and are prohibited to be used by the living for the melukat ritual.</p><p>Behind the purification, pools are the final section of the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple, called the jeroan. Mostly overlooked by tourists, the jeroan or inner courtyard is a pleasant place where people come to pray. The front part of the courtyard is dominated by the large water spring that feeds the purification pools. The spring is filled with green algae and small fish swim among the reeds. Behind the springs are large Hindu shrines. This part of the temple is nice to quickly explore. The shrines are brightly decorated, which contrasts with the starched white clothing of the Balinese who come here to pray.</p><p>As you exit Tirta Empul you pass through a large pool filled with koi fish. This section of the temple is walled off on all four sides from the rest of the complex, which gives it a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Fat koi swim lazily in the pond waiting for their next meal.</p><h3><strong>The Legend of Creation</strong></h3><p>Based on a manuscript called Usana Bali, the creation of Tirta Empul involves the myth of an epic battle between a powerful yet wicked king named Mayadenawa and a God, Bhatara Indra. The king did not believe in God, and forbade his subject from worshipping God. He was also dangerous. He possessed a spiritual power but was too drunk with his power and carelessly used it for black magic. Seeing the chaos, a priest named Sang Kulputih prayed to Bhatara Indra to put an end to the evil king.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/image3.jpg"" alt=""bali"" width=""500""></p><p>Later, Bhatara Indra and his warriors came to attack Mayadenawa and dethroned him. Mayadenawa and his troops fled to the north of a village which is now known as ‘Tampak Siring’. At night, when Bhatara Indra’s army were deep asleep, Mayadenawa snuck into their camp and created a beautiful but poisonous spring that the army would drink from upon waking up. When Mayadenawa crept into the camp, he walked on the sides of his feet so as not to leave footprints--this is believed to be the origin of the village’s name, 'Tampak Siring', which translates as 'tilted footprint'.</p><p>In the morning, Bhatara Indra awoke to find his men were poisoned to death. It was then, through his power as a God that he pierced the ground with his staff, creating a sacred healing spring of holy water. The water was sprayed onto the dead army and they came back to life. This water source which is believed to have healing properties and a source of life came to be known as Tirta Empul.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/image4.jpg"" alt=""bali"" width=""500""></p><p>Knowing that his plan had failed, Mayadenawa tried to transform himself into all sorts of different beings but to no avail, since Bhatara Indra continued to chase him. When at last he transformed himself into a boulder, Indra shot an arrow through it, and eventually killed the evil king. The blood of Mayadenawa that gushed from the boulder is believed to have formed the Petanu River, and for over a thousand years, the river was cursed making rice grow rapidly, but having an awful reek of blood. The Balinese Hindu people commemorate the death of Mayadenawa every 210 days in the Balinese traditional calendar as the day when Virtue triumphs over Evil in the ritual and ceremony called Galungan.</p><h3><strong>How To Get There</strong></h3><p>Tirta Empul temple is located roughly 14 km northeast of Ubud.

You can find many restaurants and foodstalls along the Manakara Beach all the way to the Mamuju Fishing Port that sell fried or barbecued fish, crabs, squids, prawns, and other sea food delicacies.</p><h4>Get There</h4><p>If you plan to fly to Mamuju from other parts of the country, then you must first make your way to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/sulawesi/makassar.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><u>Makassar</u></a>. This is because the only direct flight to Mamuju’s Ahmad Kirang Airport in Tampa Padang, Mamuju Regency is served by&nbsp;Wings Air&nbsp;which flies daily from Makassar to Mamuju. Other airlines may offer flights to Mamuju from other cities but through connecting flights. From the airport, downtown Mamuju is approximately 30 km away and can be reached by rented or chartered car or public mini buses.</p><p>If you wish to try the overland course, the trip from Makassar to Mamuju will take about 8-10 hours.

If you wish to take public transportation, you can take the Makassar-Mamuju buses from Makassar Bus Terminal and the trip will take 10-12 hours.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/all-revision-destination/mamujuH.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/sulawesi/mamuju

Almost all of them are decorated with white sand and granite rocks, and only a few are inhabited. One island in particular, the Lengkuas Island is the site of a 19th century antique light house. The Light House was built in Dutch colonial times and offers a beautiful overview of the area.

The island is known for its beautiful atolls and amazing underwater life covering a total area of 155,000 hectares, about 383,013.3 acres. Here, you find pristine beaches with unique Karst islands that look like mushrooms sprouting out from the sea. Along these beaches, tourists can see fairy tale panorama, more captivating than Leonardo DiCaprio’s getaway in “The Beach”. The crystal clear waters around Wayag Island appear like unreal windows to various types of flora and fauna that live underwater.</p><p>Wayag Island never ceases to amaze. Divers, especially, have been overwhelmed not only by the rich underwater displays, but also by the panoramic beauty of the island as they climb up to its highest platform and observe coves and atolls around. It is a dream come true, truly a dream fulfilled. The island is 10 km north of the equator. Liveaboards are the best choice for travelers with a love for adventure and romance. Social contacts with other travelers will only be a call away. Dive briefings are enriching, so that just being there with other divers and the exotic looking staff, you will feel as if you are already drawn into the depths of Wayag’s surreal beauty.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong>Get Around</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">How to get around in Wayag Island actually depends on where you are staying. So, plan your trip carefully and decide where to stay. If you choose to stay in one of the resorts on one of the Raja Ampat Islands, you will&nbsp;need a boat to visit Wayag Island. But if you choose a liveaboard package, you just need to sit back and enjoy the breeze in your cabin and let the schooner pass the beautiful islands.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Liveaboard packages are a comfortable alternative, and you can find these boats in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/maluku-papua/sorong"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);""><u>Sorong</u></a>, or as far away as Bali which is their&nbsp;marketing hub and port for businesses offering dive packages. Some of the liveaboards are very luxurious, and some are unique and quite fantastic. The facilities are inclusive. Many agree that liveaboards are indeed the best alternative considering time and convenience. At around US$ 300 a day, this is actually good value for money. Liveaboards usually run 10 day cruises out of the port of Sorong, in West Papua.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">It will not take a long time to travel around the unique beaches of Wayag Island. But it takes very good physical condition to enjoy the beautiful panorama from the top of an atoll, as you must climb the atoll’s steep walls for about 30 minutes.</p><p>A dinghy is probably the best means to go island hopping in a day. It is a beautiful interruption between your diving, sleeping and eating routine on your vacation in the Raja Ampat Islands.&nbsp;When hiring a speedboat as alternative, observe the surrounding islands and stop at the clear water to cool yourself after a long hour o the fast seafaring trip. Taking a speedboat is convenient as you can decide your own program.</p><p><strong>Get There</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Wayag Island is located in the West Waigeo area of the Raja Ampat Islands, northwest of the large island of Papua. Several connecting flights are needed to reach Papua. Then you must sail to Raja Ampat by boat.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">First, fly to Sorong’s Domine Eduard Osok Airport, in West Papua. Sorong is the entry point and nearest city to Raja Ampat. There are several airlines to choose from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);""><u>Jakarta&nbsp;</u></a>or&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/sulawesi/makassar"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">Makassar&nbsp;</a>to Sorong.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">For sea transportation, ships calling on Port Sorong are the Dorolonda, Labobar, Gunung Dempo, Sinabung, and the Tatamailau. Upon your arrival in Sorong, you can take a fast boat from the Sorong Fishery Port to Waisai, the capital city of the Raja Ampat district. The journey takes around two to four hours. Then from Waisai you must take a longboat to Wayag which takes some six to eight hours. Rental of this longboat is about Rp 6 million (about US$ 550) per day.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Alternatively, you can hire a speedboat to take you straight from Sorong to Wayag for a five-hour journey. This will cost about Rp 9 million (about US$ 750) a day.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/maluku-papua/west-papua/raja-ampat/wayag-island/9f81675ead7a89145956ef591edd29dae77d22a0-85b47.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/maluku-papua/raja-ampat/wayag-island

Nonetheless, irrigation of the ricefields would not be successful unless man also has a hand in it.&nbsp;Ancient inscriptions recorded the digging of an irrigation tunnel back in the year 944 AD. The complex irrigation system is complemented by a network of irrigation channels that distribute the waters to each and every paddy field.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Travel to&nbsp;<strong>Tegallalang</strong>&nbsp;some 15 km north of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/ubud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);""><u>Ubud</u></a>, or wander to the eastern slopes of&nbsp;<strong>imposing Mt.

Since farmers depend on the successful irrigation of the fields, the different Subaks form an inseparable bond that unites into a single system. This unique system has been handed down the generations for over a thousand years, whose results can be admired in the wonderful terraced ricefields of Bali.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">At the lowest level, each farmer is a member of a subak, whose ricefields is fed from a single dam. The head of the Subak, called the&nbsp;<em>Klian Subak</em>&nbsp;is elected by its members.&nbsp;In the larger subak that are fed by a canal, the lowest level is called the&nbsp;<em>tempek.</em>&nbsp;The subaks, in turn are linked to mountain temples or&nbsp;<em>pura masceti</em>, which come under the sway of one of two lake temples, these are the&nbsp;<strong>Pura Batu Kau</strong>&nbsp;which coordinates irrigation in West Bali, and&nbsp;<u>Pura Ulun Danau</u>&nbsp;which coordinates the north, east and south of Bali.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Water temples hold festivals every 105 days, corresponding with the 105 days a rice-growing season in Bali. This cycle also determines the time of opening and closing of canal sluises, ensuring that plantings are staggered and that water is allocated in the most efficient and equitable manner.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">However, every decision is always discussed at members’ meetings and unanimously agreed upon then carried down to each subak. In turn, the subak then calls their members together so that each member can decide when to start planting. Farmers then start planting in a consecutive manner after every 10 days.&nbsp;<em>(Indonesian</em>&nbsp;<em>Heritage: The Human Environment, Archipelago Press</em>).</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The Subak, of course, relates exclusively to irrigated ricefields, called “sawah”, other fields are rain-fed, and are known as tegalan.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/subak-balis-cultural-landscape/farmers.jpg"" alt=""farmers"" width=""500""></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">In Indonesia, and especially on Java and Bali,&nbsp;<strong>Rice</strong>&nbsp;is not only a staple diet, but it stands synonymous with the word Food. No meal is complete without rice. Rice is also an essential part of social and religious ceremonies, since Rice in essence forms the lifeblood of the community.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The goddess of Rice is known as Bhatari Sri, or the mother of Rice. As the Indonesian archipelago’s staple food, Dewi Sri is not only venerated in Bali, but also on Java and other rice-producing islands.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Combining sacred traditional values and a highly organized system, therefore, the Subak, the unique Balinese rice farming culture<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;a manifestation of the Balinese&nbsp;<em>Tri Hita Karana</em>&nbsp;cosmological doctrine. It is the tangible reflection of the original Balinese ideas and beliefs that are essentially rooted in this concept, namely the awareness that human beings need to always maintain harmonious relationship between Man and God, Man and fellow humans, and between Man and Nature in one’s daily life. Such particular concept is in fact evident in the Balinese creative genius and unique cultural traditions resulting from the long human interaction, especially between the Balinese and the Hindu culture.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/subak-balis-cultural-landscape/temple.jpg"" alt=""temple"" width=""500""></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">All the cluster sites of the Cultural Landscape also directly demonstrate the capability of the Balinese to make their unique cosmological doctrines a reality, practiced in their daily life through spatial planning and land use (cultural landscape), settlement arrangements, architecture, ceremonies and rituals, art, as well as social organization. Indeed the implementation of the concept has evidently generated a beautiful cultural landscape.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">For these reasons, UNESCO has designated the “Subak” –&nbsp;<strong>Bali’s Cultural Landscape</strong>&nbsp;– as World Heritage in St. Petersburg, Russia on 20 June 2012.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><em>(Source: Archipelago Press, Indonesia Heritage, the Human Environment, and&nbsp;</em><a href=""http://www.unesco.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">http://www.unesco.org</a><em>)</em></p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/subakheader.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/subak

The area is surrounded by beautiful scenery of Central Java’s nature that you can only find there.</p><p>The temple sits majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills. Built between AD 780 and 840 during the reign of Syailendra dynasty, the temple's design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region. However, there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revision-2019/image1.jpg"" alt=""borobudur"" width=""500""></p><p>It covers a total surface area of around 2,500 m2 of Kedu Valley, the southern part of Central Java. The monument is a marvel of design, decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues, surrounded by green area. The architecture and stonework of this temple have no equal. It was built without using any cement or mortar. The structure is like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without any glue. It is no wonder that Borobudur is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</p><p>The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries of neglect. It was rediscovered in 1814 under the order of Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles. In the 1970s, the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to restore Borobudur to its former majesty. The restoration took eight years to complete, making Borobudur one of Indonesia’s most valuable treasures.

Commentators claim that this is the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world, unsurpassed in artistic merit.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Get Around</strong></h3><p>When you plan to visit Borobudur temple, it is recommended to explore the site on foot. You may choose to walk through Green Park from the entrance. Many vendors will offer you souvenirs and other knick-knacks as you walk through this area. You can also find some Indonesian traditional souvenirs such as batik, traditional clothes of Indonesia and other interesting small display statues. Although there are regulations to prevent them from disturbing visitors, it is recommended to buy some traditional souvenirs that they sell to remember&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/things-to-do-while-at-borobudur-temple-start-s-from-trip-ideas-until-food"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">the beauty of Borobudur temple.</a></p><p>As you climb to the top of this magnificent temple, you will marvel at the intricately detailed stone carvings displayed on its walls. You also need to pay attention to certain etiquettes when visiting this cultural site, such as dressing nicely, avoiding any kind of vandalism, keeping your attitude, respecting the religious activities that you may find when you are there and lastly, do not over-pose when taking pictures. If you happen to wear shorts during your visit, you may have to borrow sarong and wear it around your hips.</p><p>While you are at the site, make sure to learn about its history and importance, which are captured on its many reliefs. Guides are available to help you learn more about this monument with some language options, so you do not need to worry about deepening your historical understanding of Borobudur temple. They will be able to walk you around the site and explain the history of the temple, beginning with its construction during the Syailendra dynasty and explaining each detail of it. The stone carvings attached to the temple display legends and stories, which have great philosophical significance.</p><h3><strong>Get There</strong></h3><p>Borobudur is about an one hour’s drive from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/yogyakarta"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(13, 110, 253);"">Yogyakarta</a>. The easiest way to get there is by joining a tour or renting a car. During your journey to Borobudur, you can enjoy the fresh cool air of Magelang city with its roads lined with big shady trees. Borobudur itself stands tall against the spectacular backdrop of the Menoreh mountain range that surrounds it. It is recommended to visit the site during April - October, which constitutes the dry season of the country. Also, it will be better to visit during the day instead of evening to get a clear view of the temple.&nbsp;</p><p>When you arrive at the parking site, usually you need to walk to get to the entrance gate. For international tourists, you need to prepare for 350,000 rupiahs or 25 USD to get the tickets. If you still need to buy some snacks, there are other street vendors that sell traditional cuisine of Central Java which you might have never tasted before. Entering the temple compound is easy, and most visitors choose to wander around on foot. Alternatively, you can chart a horse-drawn carriage at a reasonable price. Those cruise passengers who disembark at Semarang can also take a day tour driving through Wonosobo to Borobudur.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/headerborobudur.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/magelang-regency/borobudur

This village has been standing strong and gracefully against the force of modernization while embracing their traditionality, which has been maintained and cared for 15 generations.</p><p>In the language of the Sasak tribe in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara (NTB),&nbsp;<em>sade</em>&nbsp;means medicine or consciousness.</p><p>The culture of Sasak tribe in Sade Village has blended well with Islamic teachings. All social affairs, such as marriage, are settled at the mosque or Baruga Sekenam which is located to the left of the entrance to the traditional house area. In order to preserve the authenticity of the residents, Sade Village implements the one-family wedding custom, which means that Sade people cannot marry a person outside their tribe.</p><p>One other thing that is unique about the culture of Sade Village is its tradition of eloping (kawin lari). If a man wants to propose to a woman to be his wife, he must kidnap the girl and hide her from their family. The duration of the kidnapping and hiding could not be determined. It could be days or even months. Until at a time that was deemed appropriate, a messenger from the man’s side will visit the woman's family to inform her location and discuss the proposal and marriage plans after a consensus is reached by both parties.</p><h3>What to Do</h3><p>The first time you set foot in Sade Village, visitors will be immediately greeted by a local guide, which will assist the visitors in getting all the information they need while roaming around and enjoying the cultural beauty of the village.</p><p>There are around 150 traditional houses in Sade Village. These houses have unique roofs which are shaped like mountains and are built with reed grass. The walls and floors are made of clay mixed with rice bran, then covered with woven bamboo on the outer sides. The buildings of these houses have the title Bale Tani Gunung Ratu, which means that they are shaped like a mountain with a flat base.</p><p>It is important to note that all houses in the Sade Village area are residential houses, not exhibition buildings or cultural museums. The whole population living here is approximately 750 people who are still of the same lineage or family.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/trip-ideas/experiencing-traditional-harmony-in-sade-village-in-lombok-island/belajar-menenun.jpg"" alt=""tourists approaching a lady weaving in Sade Village""></p><p>There is a certain uniqueness when you first step foot into the houses in Sade Village. Not like the usual thing you can find in your households, in Sade Village, the floor of the house is covered with buffalo/cow dung every now and then. The goal is to keep the floor clean of dust attached, strengthen the floor, and to prevent insects from entering the house.</p><p>Another tradition in this village is weaving. For Sasak women, mastering the art of weaving--or locally known as&nbsp;<em>tenun</em>--from their childhood is an obligation. The traditional weaving of Lombok is a form of preservation of the Sasak Tribe for women. The price offered for one piece of woven cloth varies from IDR 50,000 - IDR 400,000. In addition to woven fabrics, there are many Lombok souvenirs that are made directly by the Sasak people, such as key chains and accessories.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/trip-ideas/experiencing-traditional-harmony-in-sade-village-in-lombok-island/tenun.jpg""></p><h3>Things to Do Nearby</h3><p>If you are looking to explore further, you can find Ende Tourism Village approximately 3 minutes drive to the north of Sade Village. The village is also a home to Sasak tribe, only it has a slightly different tradition than the people in Sade Village. One of the unique things about this village is the doors of the houses, which are made smaller than usual. According to local belief, the doors are deliberately built short so the guests who enter have to bow their heads and bodies to show their respects to the owner of the house.</p><p>At sunset, you can choose to ride south to Kuta Mandalika Beach: one of the few places in Lombok where you can see an otherworldly beautiful sunset scenery. Get ready to be enchanted by its many charms from the clarity of the sea water to the beautiful and sturdy rocks. Furthermore, Kuta Mandalika Beach also presents the charm of a clean and white sand stretching for 7,2 kilometers long. It’s only 15 minutes drive from Sade Village and it will surely complete your whole trip to the tropical island of Lombok.</p><h3>How to Get There</h3><p>Getting to Sade Village from downtown Mataram takes about 1 to 1,5 hours. Meanwhile, from Lombok International Airport it only takes about 25 to 30 minutes. There is no public transportation that can get you to Sade Village so you will need to rent a car or motorbike.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/trip-ideas/experiencing-traditional-harmony-in-sade-village-in-lombok-island/header.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/lombok/experiencing-traditional-harmony-in-sade-village-in-lombok-island

With the crashing waves below and the dramatic colors of the dusk sky as background, lit by the slowly disappearing sun. Tanah Lot is located in Tabanan, only around 30 km away from Denpasar. The temple is located some 300 meters offshore. The history of Tanah Lot temple was believed to date back to the 16th century, by Dang Hyang Nirartha, a respected religious figure in Bali.</p><p>Dang Hyang Nirartha was said to be the one who created a three-temple system in Balinese villages. Setting the site plan that the temple built in the northern area of the village would be for Brahma, middle area for Vishnu and the southern side for Shiva. While traveling along the southern coast of Bali, he saw the little rock-island and decided to spend the night. The rock was known as Gili Beo, which means a bird-shaped rock, located in Beraban village. He then felt an enlightenment, that this was a holy place to build a shrine. The leader of Beraban was angry and order people to banish Nirartha from Gili Beo.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/tanahlot1.jpg"" alt=""Magnificent Balinese Temple in the Open Ocean""></p><p>In Balinese mythology, Dang Hyang Nirartha was known as a man of mighty supernatural power. So he moves the whole rock island to the sea, builds a temple and named it Tanah Lot. The whole Beraban village were astounded and later join to follow he believes. Tanah Lot temple was built to worship Bhatara Segara, or the sea God. To protect the temple, with his mighty power, he created a poisonous snake from his sash. The sea snake is believed to be living at the base of this rocky island, to guard the temple from evil intruders.</p><p>Today, as one of the most photographed sea temple in Bali, you will find many art shops offering local handicrafts besides other signature local products at the entrance to get to Tanah Lot.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/sajen.jpg"" alt=""Magnificent Balinese Temple in the Open Ocean""></p><p>The best time to visit Tanah Lot is during Odalan, which is celebrated every 210 days. The rituals usually takes place near the Galungan and Kuningan festivities on the holy day known as Buddha Cemeng Langkir. On this day you will see rows of Balinese women gracefully carrying offerings on their head to pray at the temple of Tanah Lot. The tourist area of Tanah Lot near the rock is very well managed for visitors. It has a parking area, toilets, art shops, restaurants, hotel, open stage, tourist information center, security and safety services.</p><p>There are many restaurants here where you can enjoy a sumptuous breakfast or lunch, while enjoying the panorama.

Coming from Denpasar on the main highway and arriving in the town of Kediri, you will certainly not miss the large sign at the main intersection announcing the southwest turn to Pura Tanah Lot. To reach the temple of Tanah Lot you will need to cross some dry land then climb a hill to reach the site of the temple<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Get Around</strong></p><p>Inside the temple area, you can just walk around and explore its photogenic surroundings. Although famous for its sunset view, you may also want to try coming at really early in the morning, so that there will be less crowd and higher chance to have a serene image of the temple. There are also several temples that you can visit around Tanah Lot. They are Pura Pekendungan, Pura Batu Bolong, Pura Jero Kandang, Pura Enjung Galuh, and Pura Batu Mejan.</p><p>These temples have a variety of legends and myths surrounding their historical roots. When Nirartha left Beraban village, he bestows a special keris -a blade like a traditional weapon- to the Beraban leaders. The Ki Batu Gajah keris was said to possess the ability to repel plant diseases from crops. This keris was kept in Pura Pekendungan, before it is now safely stored in Puri Kediri. But on Odalan day, Ki Batu Gajah keris is always involved in the ceremonies.</p><p>Pura Batu Bolong is another extraordinary sea temples build upon a jutting rock cliff. Batu Bolong means “hollowed stone”, depicted from its obvious characteristic. It is said to be the twin of Tanah Lot, with many similar features between the two.</p><p>Located in Canggu, Batu Bolong sea temple is the cradle of the holy spring water. Many important Balinese rituals and ceremonies are held on this stunning location.

Thus, the town was a busy harbor with trade connections to Malacca and the Spice Islands of east Indonesia.</p><p>Around the 15th Century, the channel was sufficiently wide and became an important waterway for ships sailing along the northern Javanese coast to the Spice Islands. The channel was also connected to the Serang River, which enabled access to the rice-producing interior of Java. This strategic location enabled Demak to rise as a leading trading center in Java. However, since the 17th century, the channel silted up, shallowed, and eventually vanished completely, thus merging the island of Muria with mainland Java.</p><p>The founding of the Demak Sultanate was traditionally attributed to Raden Patah (1475–1518), a Javanese nobleman related to the once-powerful Majapahit king of East Java. At least one account stated that Raden Patah was, in fact, the son of Kertabhumi, who reigned as king Brawijaya V of Majapahit (1468–1478). Demak managed to consolidate its power and defeated Daha in 1527 because it was more widely accepted as the legitimate successor to Majapahit. The reason for this acceptance was because Raden Patah was believed to be a direct descendant of Kertabhumi who survived the invasion by Girindrawardana on Trowulan, capital of Majapahit, in 1478.</p><p>With the full support of the Wali Songo or the Nine Apostles of Islam, the Demak Sultanate rose to become the most prominent Islamic kingdom on Java and the center in the spread of Islam in Java.</p><p>The symbol of the golden era of the Demak Sultanate and the early spread of Islam in Java still stands today, which is the Masjid Agung Demak or the Great Mosque of Demak.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/agung.jpg"" alt=""agung"" width=""500""></p><h2><strong>The Great Mosque of Demak</strong></h2><p>Built in 1478, the Great Mosque of Demak is believed to be the first mosque in Java and one of the oldest in Indonesia. Constructed collectively by the Wali Songo and Raden Patah as the first ruler of the Demak Sultanate, the mosque holds great significance as it was not merely a place for prayers but at the time was also the center of the sultan’s governance and the venue where the walis (apostles) used to meet to discuss matters.</p><p>Although the Mosque has undergone a number of renovations, it is thought to have largely remained in its original form. The mosque is a classic example of the traditional Javanese mosque. Unlike mosques in the Middle East, this one was built of timber without a dome, which only appeared on Indonesian mosques by the 19th century. The tiered roof shows many similarities to the wooden religious structures from the Hindu-Buddhist civilizations on Java and Bali.</p><p>The main entrance of the Great Mosque of Demak consists of two doors carved with motifs of plants, vases, crowns and an animal head with a wide-open fanged mouth. It is said that the picture depicts the manifested thunder caught by Ki Ageng Selo, hence their name “Lawang Bledheg” or “the doors of thunder.”</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/great-mosque.jpg"" alt=""mosque"" width=""500""></p><p>The historical and legendary parts of the mosque are the large four main wooden pillars, called the soko guru, that support the heavy wooden roof of the mosque. With each pillar carved out of single trees with a height reaching 16 meters, the four main pillars are placed according to the four cardinal directions and were set up by members of the Wali Songo. The Northwest Pillar was erected by Sunan Bonang, the Southwest by Sunan Gunung Jati, the South East by Sunan Ampel, and the very exceptional pillar known as Soko Tatal which is constructed from joined pieces of wood scrap and erected on the northeast by Sunan Kalijaga. The original four soko guru were replaced with replicas in 1983 and the originals are now placed in the museum in the mosque compound.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/image/forpilar.jpg"" alt=""forpilar"" width=""500""></p><p>The tomb of Sunan Kalijaga located in the village of Kadilangu approximately 2 kilometers from the Mosque is another legacy from the early Javanese Islamic era frequently visited by visitors and pilgrims. Every year during the “Grebeg Besar” ritual ceremony (which falls on 10 Dzulhijah of the Islamic Calendar) when various heirlooms are ritually cleansed, thousands of visitors and pilgrims flock to Demak to take part in the event.</p><h2><strong>How to Get There</strong></h2><p>Demak lies on the main north coast highway – known as Pantura – between Central Java and East Java, connecting Semarang with Surabaya.&nbsp;The town of Demak is only 25 Kilometers or about 30-40 minutes’ drive from Semarang, capital of Central Java. There is also a lot of public transportation available in Semarang or intercity buses that pass through Demak.</p><h2>How to Get Around</h2><p>Demak also has a lot of public transportation for you to get around, but we suggest you rent a car or motorcycle for a convenient way to go anywhere you want. Aside from the Great Mosque of Demak and the Tomb of Sunan Kalijaga, there are many other attractions that you must explore. Head to Sayung District and you will find Morosari Beach: a mangrove coastline with unexpectedly stunning scenery, especially at sunset. If you’re looking for a delectable seafood cuisine, come to Tirangan Beach in Babalan Village in the early evening and you will be treated with a range of seafood dishes made with newly-captured sea products by the local fishermen.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/central-java/demak/cf2979ce9f4a17b9e6ef1719e529c05f019a9ccf-e69ed.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/demak

In fact, Jakarta is a conglomeration of villages known as <em>kampung</em>, now crossed by main roads and superhighways.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/Image1.jpg"" alt=""A City that Never Sleeps""></p><h2>The Charm of the Metropolis</h2><p>A part of the local experience is that you may drive down one wide avenue one minute, then suddenly find yourself squeezed into a small street together with scores of cars and motorbikes. With its many suburbs, Jakarta has become a<a href=""http://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/jakarta-indonesia-s-capital-of-splendors"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;Megapolitan city</a>. Therefore, when you visit Jakarta it is best to invest in a good map or rely on GPS to navigate around.</p><p>Jakarta is not only the seat of the national government and the provincial government, but it is also Indonesia’s political center. Moreover, Jakarta is the hub of Indonesia’s national finance and trade. It is no wonder, that you will find Jakarta as a dynamic city, with activities taking place around-the-clock throughout its populated areas.</p><p>This city is divided into 5 districts, namely <em>Jakarta Pusat, Jakarta Utara, Jakarta Barat, Jakarta Timur, and Jakarta Selatan</em>. The term <em>‘Jabodetabek’</em> refers to <em>Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi</em> - <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/10-exciting-jakarta-shopping-spree-experience-s.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">the Greater Jakarta area</a> consists of megacities surrounding the capital.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/Image2.jpg"" alt=""A City that Never Sleeps""></p><p>Jakarta Pusat or central Jakarta is where you can find the iconic landmarks such as Monas,<a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/merdeka-palace-and-state-palace"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> The Merdeka Palace</a>, <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/national-museum.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The National Museum</a>, <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/the-grand-istiqlal-mosque.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Istiqlal Mosque</a>, The <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/catholic-catedral"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Jakarta Cathedral</a>, and Monumen Selamat Datang or the welcome monument widely renowned as Bunderan HI.</p><p>Some of the most prestigious shopping malls and upscale hotels are located right in the heart of Central Jakarta. Here you can enjoy the 24 hours excitements of Jakarta!</p><p>Jakarta Utara or North Jakarta is where Taman Impian Jaya Ancol or <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/15-thing-s-you-can-do-inside-ancol-dreamland.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Ancol Dreamland</a> is located. It boasts a variety of amusements such as Dufan Theme park, Seaworld, Atlantis Water Adventure Park, Ecopark, an Art market and comfortable accommodation choices with a complete culinary destination.</p><p>From Ancol Bay, you can hop on a boat and head to Jakarta’s pristine getaway, enriched with tropical islands named Kepulauan Seribu, or The Seribu Archipelago and sometimes also simply famous as The Thousand Islands.</p><p>Here, there are more than 10 islands that one can explore. Some of the most famous are Bidadari, Tidung, Pari and Pulau Macan, the home of private beach huts that lets you plunge directly from your bed to the open sea.</p><p>Jakarta Barat or West Jakarta, Jakarta Timur or East Jakarta and Jakarta Selatan or South Jakarta are those areas where a cluster of houses are located alongside offices, public facilities and more choices of shopping malls!</p><p>The amazing historical heritage in West Jakarta is Museum Fatahillah and its surrounding Kota Tua or Old Jakarta district is where you can ride a classic bike to tour the area. The new iconic destination in West Jakarta is the contemporary art exhibition venue named Museum Macan, where Yayoi Kusama’s artworks are displayed.</p><p>In East Jakarta, you can visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, the miniature of Indonesia Archipelago. You can explore the details of traditional houses and a glimpse of Indonesia’s diverse culture in this park.</p><p>When visiting South Jakarta, make sure to drop by at <a href=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/trip-ideas/10-betawi-uniqueness-that-you-can-find-in-setu-babakan.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Setu Babakan</a> and get to know the story of Betawi culture, the native ethnic group of Jakarta. There are a museum and traditional Betawi houses with few activities that you can experience, such as getting to know the traditional dance and music, tasting the local beverage of Bir Pletok, have a bite of Kerak Telor and making small ondel ondel, the iconic figure of Jakarta!</p><p>All parts of Jakarta are studded with their own culinary icons and trending coffee shops to spend the day at. Here, you can easily find the five national foods, namely Nasi Goreng, Gado-gado, Soto, Sate, and Rendang.</p><p> <img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/Image3.jpg"" alt=""A City that Never Sleeps""></p><p>Indonesia’s Independence Day is also celebrated annually on the 17th of August with various activities throughout the nation. Especially in Jakarta, you will find communities decorating their homes with the national color of red and white.</p><p>Unique games and races are packed with participants of all ages. Balap Karung or the sack race and Panjat Pinang or the Pinang climb are two iconic games that are always crowded with spectators.</p><h2>Get There</h2><p><strong>By Air&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jakarta has two international airports, one is the larger Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, located in Tangerang, now in the neighboring province of Banten. The other is the smaller Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, which is reserved for limited domestic flights.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overland</strong></p><p>As the nation’s capital, Jakarta is connected by land to major cities in Java, public transport to get to Jakarta is available by bus and train.</p><p>People who visit Jakarta, usually take time to stop by the neighboring Bogor, famous for it's Botanical Garden and highlands getaway in the Puncak area.</p><p>Or if you prefer the coastal area, head to Banten and spend a holiday at Anyer and Carita Beach.</p><p><strong>By Sea&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Tanjung Priok is the name of Jakarta’s seaport, located in North Jakarta. It is the busiest seaport in Indonesia.</p><p>In April 2018, Genting Dream Cruises, based in Singapore, has opened special itineraries to visit Indonesia’s capital for this summer to voyage. A delightful choice for the one who wants to splurge aboard a luxurious cruise ship.</p><h2>Get Around</h2><p>The best way to travel around Jakarta is by rented car, taxi or package tour. Be prepared though to meet traffic jams, especially when traveling during peak hours and into business districts, including the Old Batavia area.&nbsp;</p><p>It is advisable therefore to choose a hotel near the location where you will have your meeting or business appointments or to the attraction or destination you wish to visit. Distances between points of interest in Jakarta can sometimes be far and might be interspersed with traffic.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta/jakarta/9fe4c537ae976df197ea11dfbd43e42e8a886816-cd2d9.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/content/indtravelrevamp/gb/en/destinations/java/dki-jakarta

Located about 10Km North West off the shore of Bali’s mainland, the small island of Menjangan forms part of the West Bali National Park Conservation Area. The word ""Menjangan"" in the Javanese language means ""Deer"". According to Wikipedia, the name was given by the local population who observed wild deer herds swimming to the island every spring covering a distance of approx 1.2 miles.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/menjangan-island-west-balis-best-kept-secret-dive-site/menjangan-beach.jpg"" alt=""menjangan"" width=""500""></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">This small island is actually where diving first started seriously on Bali back in about 1978 under the sponsorship of the Indonesian Navy, when it arranged a get-together of the country’s main diving clubs -Possi, Ganesha, Nusantara, and Trisakti. That get-together led to Menjangan establishing itself as the premier international dive location in Bali and many of the attendees went on to become the pioneers of commercial dive operations across Indonesia.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/menjangan-island-west-balis-best-kept-secret-dive-site/underwater.jpg"" alt=""underwater"" width=""500""></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The island itself is surrounded by a coral reef, characterized by deep drop offs of near to 60 meters and by complex rock formations. These distinctive features have given rise to a great number of large and small caves, festooned with sponge and soft corals and often inhabited by large groupers, moray eels and by young snappers and batfish in the smaller caves. The sea beds are also rich in large barrel sponges and vibrant sea fans, some of which are truly enormous. Given the depth, the moderate flow of currents and its protection from strong winds, it is common to see tuna, shoals of jack-fish, batfish, angelfish, sea turtles, and on occasion also sharks, especially off the outer corners of the island.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The island is also known as the location for the best wall diving in Bali, with a very bright &amp; colorful underwater world and lots of different sites to choose from. These dive sites are rich in marine life and sandy beaches to relax over lunch.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/menjangan-island-west-balis-best-kept-secret-dive-site/fishes.jpg"" alt=""fishes"" width=""500""></p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">At a depth of 45 meters the Anchor wreck is found. Also called the Anker or Kapal Budak (Slave Ship), the site is an old wooden ship wreck sitting on the sea floor on the western tip of Menjangan which is either an 19th century Dutch ship that sunk during WWII or one that sunk much earlier during the Dutch colonial era while supposedly carrying Balinese slaves to Batavia (now Jakarta). The wreck contains a cargo of ceramics and glass bottles and is completely colonized by soft coral; an excellent place to meet turtles and sharks.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Named after a large colony of garden eels, the Eel Gardens dive site lies on the western point of Menjangan in a shallow area with some dazzling white sand that is a pleasant dive in itself. The dive starts on a nice wall (about 40m) with a lot of beautiful gorgonians and other sea fans then continue over the top of the reef to a stretch of white sand. Arguably, some say that this is the best part of Menjangan Island.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">And there is a big surprise for macro-photographers, video-operators and marine biologists at the Secret Bay”. In the small bay near the ferry port of Gilimanuk, a strange play in currents has rendered the water temperature here to be more, at most 25 degree C, which has created a habitat for Pacific and Indian Ocean species, with often hybrids between the two. The muddy shallow beds, mixed with algae and debris, are host to truly strange marine creatures, some of which have recently been discovered by marine biologists for the first time, such as the 4 types of anglerfish including the Sargassum Anglerfish, Spotfin Anglerfish and one in particular that has created great interest among biologists, locally called the Tono’s Anglerfish. Apart from the anglerfish, the bay is host to numerous different sea horses, dragonets, ghostpipefish, nudibranches, lionfish such us the Blue Finned lionfish, ribbon eels and much more. This unique bay has been and still is the preferred location of some of the world’s most famous underwater photographers and filmmakers, as well as researchers and marine biologists.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/point-of-interest/menjangan-island/956f26b1a8d9c11d6797904662b0d3c5d253d72d-ab584.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/menjangan-island

Then go north until you find the road sign to Besakih, and after a few kilometers from this point turn north. If you are staying around Klungkung, then Besakih is about 20 kilometers north of the town center. Take the Bemo – the small public buses– that will take you to Besakih from Klungkung. Bemos are most frequent in the morning, and it is recommended to change bemos at Rendang, halfway between Klungkung and Besakih.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/revamp-image/destination/besakih-3.jpg"" alt=""“amed"" width=""500""></p><p>If you come from the north of Denpasar, it is about 25 kilometers to reach Besakih by car.

This will lead you to the crossroad between Besakih and Klungkung at Rendang, and then turn right to reach Besakih Temple.During your hour-long drive, you will enjoy beautiful views traveling through forests, villages, and rice fields.

Jineng became unique because its position should be made to be higher than other areas. In addition, the shape also looks like a cave with a dry straw roof. However, jineng or klumpu is now rarely found. This area functions as a storage for the grain that has been dried.</p><p>According to the philosophy of the Balinese, dynamism in life will be achieved if there is a harmonious relationship between the aspects of Parahyangan, Pawongan, as well as Palemahan. Therefore, the construction of traditional houses must include the aspect known as ""Tri Hita Karana,"" with “Parahyangan” as the divine being, “Pawongan” as the resident of the house, “Palemahan” as the well-maintained connection between occupants and the environment.</p><p>The architecture philosophy of Asta Kosala Kosali can be likened to “Feng Shui” in Chinese culture. In building traditional houses, Balinese will put emphasis on the importance of where each structure is facing because direction has important meanings in Balinese culture.</p><p>The thing that is considered sacred or holy is to put a house in the direction of the mountain, which is a highly sacred object for Balinese. The term of this direction is called “kaja.” Meanwhile, the thing that is not considered sacred will be faced in the direction of the sea, which is called “kelod.”</p><p>In terms of housing architecture, Balinese cannot separate their religion and custom from their mundane life. The philosophy is always to be there, being one as a part of their livelihood.

Nonetheless, irrigation rice fields would not be successful unless man also has a hand in it.Uniquely, Bali's complex irrigation system has its roots not by order of kings, but its management is very much in the hands of the villagers through village cooperatives. Since farmers depend on the successful irrigation of the fields, the different Subaks form an inseparable bond that unites into a single system.</p><p class=""ql-align-center""><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/bali/bali/point-of-interest/jatiluwih/1a9bdb13a347280f71c3e46a6f5b80fe5c5eac4e-f067c.jpg"" alt=""The Amazing JATILUWIH RICE TERRACES: Beauty and Bali’s Local Genius"" width=""500""></p><p>At the lowest level, each farmer is a member of a subak, whose rice fields are fed from a single dam.

Approximately 50 meters in height, it is as tall as a 12-storey building. While the lighthouse itself is an exceptional feature, the spectacle it offers from the top is truly spellbinding. Here one can get a complete 360 degree view of the fascinating Island and all the wonders that surround it, including the crystal clear waters and other spreading tiny islands.</p><p><strong>Get There</strong></p><p>To reach Lengkuas Island you can rent a boat available at several beaches in Belitung such as at Tanjung Kelayang, Tanjung Binga, or Tanjung Tinggi. From Tanjung Kelayang the boat trip will take approximately 20 minutes, while from Tanjung Binga or Tanjung Tinggi it will take about 30-45 minutes.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Along the way you’ll be presented with fascinating sceneries of several small islands off the coast of Belitung.

Barong is seen as ‘a guardian angel’. Opposing Good is represented by another mythical creature called Rangda (‘widow’ in Javanese), the Queen of Demons. Rangda leads an army of evil witches against the leader of the forces of Good. As a mirror of life, the Barong Dance portrays the two characters involved in a never-ending battle.</p><p>Similar to Sanghyang Dance, the Barong Dance is native to the Balinese culture that predates back to Hinduism. Barong is covered in white thick fur, adorned with gold jewelry and pieces of mirrors. Just like the Chinese Lion Dance, Barong involves two people dancing in synchronized movements to portray the lion in action.</p><p><img src=""https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/revisi-2020/barong2.jpg"" alt=""barong dance"" width=""500""></p><p>In the dance drama called Calon Arang, Barong emerges to counteract Rangda's use of magic to control the world. The men will fight each other with kris daggers, but upon the appearance of Barong, they turn their kris and stab themselves. The performers get into a trance state. Barong then defeats Rangda, thus restoring balance in nature. Meanwhile, the tranced men are reincarnated by the sprinkle of holy water.</p><p>Balinese people believe each region has its own protective spirit for its forests and lands. For each region, Barong is modeled after a different animal. Barong Ket (Lion Barong) is the most common type found in almost every part of the Island. While Barong Buntut is a type of Barong which only features its front, usually performed by a single dancer.

Rinjani's Mystifying Danau Segara Anak</strong></h1><p><strong>Danau Segara Anak</strong>&nbsp;is a volcanic lake formed in the caldera of&nbsp;<strong>Mount Rinjani</strong>&nbsp;on over 2,000 meters above sea level. The lake spans across an area of 11 square kilometers, and reaches depths up to 230 meters. Danau Segara Anak is located on the west side of Mount Rinjani in the village of Lawang Sembalun in&nbsp;<strong>Lombok,&nbsp;</strong>East Indonesia. The mystifyingly blue colour of the lake gives Segara Anak its name: Small Ocean.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">The trek from the Senaru Village, and through the crater to Danau Segara Anak takes two days and a night. It begins with a hike through a lush, tropical rainforest, and up the mountain to the rim of the crater. The trek to the Senaru rim is a challenging climb up steep terrain and high cliffs, but the exhaustion is well rewarded by the breathtaking panoramic view of the sun setting over Mount Rinjani,&nbsp;<strong>Bali&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>Gili Isles&nbsp;</strong>on the horizon, and the dazzling blue waters of Segara Anak glistening hundreds of meters below. The top of the crater is a popular camp site for both foreign and domestic tourists on this journey to spend the night. It is advisable to set a morning alarm so as not to miss the magnificence of dawn from atop Rinjani.From the crater’s rim, it is a sharp descent of about 600 meters to Danau Segara Anak.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Part of Segara Anak flows down a steep ravine forming one large waterfall and several smaller ones. There are also four natural hot springs in the lake which are said to hold magical healing powers, and many make the climb solely for medicinal purposes.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Despite its high altitudes, taking a dip in the lake is not as cold as one might imagine. 2,010 meters above sea level, the surface water of the lake is unusually warm for such heights, at about 20-22 degrees Celsius—well above the mountain’s “room temperature,” which is about 14-15 degrees Celsius.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Between 2008 and 2009, researchers of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation as well as UniversiteLibre de Bruxells conducted a geochemical and thermodynamic study on Segara Anak. The tests showed several leaks in the volcanic system of Gunung Baru; the cone in the center of the lake. These leaks from the magma chamber seep a large supply of hot water into Segara Anak, indicating a direct relationship between volcanic activity and the lake’s high temperature. The geochemical composition of the hot water showed a number of elements such as chloride, sodium, potassium, and sulphate. Although rich in elements, rainwater that enters the lake assists in thinning its chemical content. Segara Anak also maintains excellent circulation, and is therefore not harmful to life.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Lake water circulation takes place when the density of the water is higher at the surface than at the base. Rainwater has a higher density than the hydrothermal water, and therefore moves downward, while waters from the hydrothermal vent move up. This is an on-going process providing well-mixed water and bringing the acid level of the lake to neutral—suitable for breeding fish.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">In 1969, volcanologists from the Directorate of Geology, (London,) examined the lake and recommended the cultivation of fish. At that time, there were no fish in Segara Anak. In 1985, the Nusa Tenggara Barat provincial government finally began breeding fish in the lake. The fish bred rapidly and the lake is now home to millions of tilapia and carp, making Segara Anak not only a popular spot for fishing, but some locals of the area even make a living from this.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">In the 1980’s, the areas surrounding Segara Anak pulsated with wildlife. Grouse, hornbill, and barking deer thrived around the lake. Several species of monkey could be found in the forests, including the rare black ebony leaf monkey, and the black crested macaque, indigenous to Indonesia. But human intervention has changed the ecology of the lake. With more and more people climbing up the mountain and into the lake, more and more species have begun to disappear. Initially, people only caught fish, but then grouse, which soon led to deer hunting as well. Now few grouse remain, and the deer are no longer found along the route. It is estimated that only a hundred or so remain.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">In 1998, Danau Segara Anak was immortalized in paper money on the ten thousand rupiah bill.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">Like other crater lakes around the world, Danau Segara Anak was born of a violent past, celebrates a brilliant present, and has the potential to lead to a catastrophic future. Yet we remain fascinated by its origin, splendour and unique existence.</p>",https://www.indonesia.travel/content/dam/indtravelrevamp/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/west-nusa-tenggara/lombok/point-of-interest/danau-segara-anak/f4313ae7e83e693f81ea92b69726907ead804762-c9977.jpg,https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/bali-nusa-tenggara/lombok/danau-segara-anak
